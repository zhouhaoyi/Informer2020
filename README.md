## ProbSparse Attention
The self-attention scores form a long-tail distribution, where the "active" queries lie in the "head" scores and "lazy" queries lie in the "tail" area. We designed the ProbSparse Attention to select the "active" queries rather than the "lazy" queries. The ProbSparse Attention with Top-u queries forms a sparse Transformer by the probability distribution.
`Why not use Top-u keys?` The self-attention layer's output is the re-represent of input. It is formulated as a weighted combination of values w.r.t. the score of dot-product pairs. The top queries with full keys encourage a complete re-represent of leading components in the input, and it is equivalent to selecting the "head" scores among all the dot-product pairs. If we choose Top-u keys, the full keys just preserve the trivial sum of values within the "long tail" scores but wreck the leading components' re-represent.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- matplotlib == 3.1.1
- numpy == 1.19.4
- pandas == 0.25.1
- scikit_learn == 0.21.3
- torch == 1.4.0

Dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The ETT dataset used in the paper can be download in the repo [ETDataset](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/ETDataset).
The required data files should be put into `data/ETT/` folder. A demo slice of the ETT data is illustrated in the following figure. Note that the input of each dataset is zero-mean normalized in this implementation.

## Usage
<span id="colablink">Colab Examples:</span> We provide google colabs to help reproducing and customing our repo, which includes `experiments(train and test)`, `prediction`, `visualization` and `custom data`.
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_X7O2BkFLvqyCdZzDZvV2MB0aAvYALLC)

Commands for training and testing the model with *ProbSparse* self-attention on Dataset ETTh1, ETTh2 and ETTm1 respectively:

```bash
# ETTh1
python -u main_informer.py --model informer --data ETTh1 --attn prob

# ETTh2
python -u main_informer.py --model informer --data ETTh2 --attn prob

# ETTm1
python -u main_informer.py --model informer --data ETTm1 --attn prob
```

More parameter information please refer to `main_informer.py`.

## FAQ
If you run into a problem like `RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (98) must match the size of tensor b (96) at non-singleton dimension 1`, you can check torch version or modify code about `Conv1d` of `TokenEmbedding` in `models/embed.py` as the way of circular padding mode in Conv1d changed in different torch versions.
